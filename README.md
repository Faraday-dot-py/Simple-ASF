# Simple Alliance Scouting Framework (Simple ASF)

The Simple Alliance Scouting Framework is a simple, easy-to-use framework for creating scouting apps for the FIRST Robotics Competition.
It is built using React, and is designed to be easy to use for people with little to no coding experience.
It is also designed to be easily customizable so you can make your app look however you want.

One of the main strengths of this framework is that it can be used to create a scouting app for any game, not just the current one.
Meaning, you can use this framework to create a scouting app for the 2030 season, even though we have no idea what it will entail. (shout out to my friends in 2030)
